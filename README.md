What was the problem I was trying to solve? Job opportunitties found in the United States between 2007-2013, in regards to Millenials compared to Baby Boomers. 

How did I prepare my data? I loaded my data into Tablaeu, removed unnecessary headers and fixed date character.

What if any future work do you plan to keep on doing to improve your app? Any future changes could be updated for current statistics on job opportunities for Millenials and Baby Boomers.
